# cDFT
Attempt to learn classical density functional theory (FMT) of inhomogeneous fluids.

* All code needs tidying up.
* All code needs commenting and thorough descriptions. Useful as revision/learning material.
* 3D FMT needs completing... first job = generate correct weighted densities (used in convolutions wrt liquid density).
